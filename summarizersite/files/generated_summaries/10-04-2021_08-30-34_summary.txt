Proteins consist of amino acids which are organic compounds that occur naturally.
Some foods provide complete protein which means they contain all the essential amino acids the body needs.
Most plantbased foods do not contain complete protein so a person who follows a vegan diet needs to eat a range of foods throughout the day that provides the essential amino acids.
