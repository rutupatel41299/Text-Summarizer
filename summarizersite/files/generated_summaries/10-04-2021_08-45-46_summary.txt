Kolkata SwitchON Foundation along with Punjab National Bank PNB has set up the first loss default guarantee fund to offer finance to the marginal farmers for buying solar pumps.
This is a unique agreement between a private notforprofit organisation and a leading public sector bank to set up a guarantee fund which is otherwise usually set up by government bodies” said Vinay Jaju of SwitchON Foundation.
The basic aim of the fund is to help unbanked small marginal farmers without any collateral.
