Consequent to the accident
Psychologically there has been no consequence of the accident.  
The accident caused him to have two weeks off work but did not otherwise interfere with his lifestyle.  
In my opinion on the balance of probability full physical recovery can be anticipated from the effects of the accident at a time within six months of the date of the accident.
I base my opinion on the facts that recovery to date has been satisfactory the range of movement of his cervical spine is full and there were no adverse features associated with the accident.  
The Client is a good historian and his injuries are consistent with the accident.
In my opinion examination of the notes is not required as the Client is a good and reliable historian and the injuries sustained are compatible with the accident described.
