Machine learning as a concept has been around for quite some time.
The term “machine learning” was coined by Arthur Samuel a computer scientist at IBM and a pioneer in AI and computer gaming.
Samuel designed a computer program for playing checkers.
The more the program played the more it learned from experience using algorithms to make predictions.
As a discipline machine learning explores the analysis and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data.
With massive amounts of computational ability behind a single task or multiple specific tasks machines can be trained to identify patterns in and relationships between input data and automate routine processes.
