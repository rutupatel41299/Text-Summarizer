Anatomically the eyeball can be divided into three parts – the fibrous vascular and inner layers.
Layers of the EyeballThe eyeball is formed by three layers – fibrous vascular and inner.
Each of these layers has a specialised structure and function.
FibrousThe fibrous layer of the eye is the outermost layer.
The sclera comprises the majority of the fibrous layer approximately 85.
VascularThe vascular layer of the eye lies underneath the fibrous layer.
It consists of the choroid ciliary body and irisChoroid – layer of connective tissue and blood vessels.
It provides nourishment to the outer layers of the retina.
InnerThe inner layer of the eye is formed by the retina its light detecting component.
The retina is composed of two layersPigmented outer layer – formed by a single layer of cells.
Neural inner layer – consists of photoreceptors the light detecting cells of the retina.
Anteriorly the pigmented layer continues but the neural layer does not – this is part is known as the nonvisual retina.
Posteriorly and laterally both layers of the retina are present.
