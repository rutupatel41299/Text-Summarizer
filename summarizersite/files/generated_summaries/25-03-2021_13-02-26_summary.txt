Tropical Storm Gilbert strengthened into an eastern Caribbean hurricane on Saturday  night September 10 1988.  
The storm now one of the largest systems seen in the Caribbean for a long time  slowly traversed the length of the island causing massive damage and nineteen deaths.   
The storm then passed over the Cayman Islands located south of Cuba.  
Cuba and our  American military bases there both avoided the brunt of the storm before it slammed full  force into the Yucatan Peninsula.  
Scientists do not fully understand why some minor tropical storms strengthen into  hurricanes while others do not.
