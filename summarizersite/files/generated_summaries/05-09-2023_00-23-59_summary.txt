A meteorite is a solid piece of debris from an object such as a comet asteroid or meteoroid that originates in outer space and survives its passage through the atmosphere to reach the surface of a planet or moon.
When the original object enters the atmosphere various factors such as friction pressure and chemical interactions with the atmospheric gases cause it to heat up and radiate energy.
Once it settles on the larger body's surface the meteor becomes a meteorite.
For geologists a bolide is a meteorite large enough to create an impact crater.2Meteorites that are recovered after being observed as they transit the atmosphere and impact the Earth are called meteorite falls.
Meteorites less than 1 mm in diameter are classified as micrometeorites however micrometeorites differ from meteorites in that they typically melt completely in the atmosphere and fall to Earth as quenched droplets.
