The northern California earthquake of October 17 1989 caused extensive damage to buildings and roadways.
An official of the California Seismic Safety Commission said that assessing the disaster was like the blind man trying to feel an elephant.
Another onsite observer commented that the quake was like somebody slugging a punching bag.
Usually earthquakes pass
In Sacramento Governor Deukmejian called a special session of the California legislature to deal with the disaster but was perceived as blaming others for the collapse of freeways.
The Governor had earlier opposed an increase in the gasoline tax intended to augment transportation funding  a step which appeared highly desirable after the quake left hundreds of thousands of commuters unable to reach work.
