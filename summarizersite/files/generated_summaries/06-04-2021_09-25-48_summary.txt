This year's Union Budget was commended for its approach to helping India recover from the Covid19 pandemic and the subsequent economic slump.
However while the Centre has promised economic stimulus government spending without attention to building adequate state capacity to effectively use those funds will arguably not achieve the desired impact.
We refer to state capacity as the state's ability to provide for its citizens.
During 2020 Budget it was reported that the Centre did not spend 34.9 of the assigned funds in the preceding FY the average magnitude of unspent funds is usually greater at the state and local levels.
Also government allocations are often not aligned with actual spending i.e. there is disconnect between fiscal allotments and development outcomes associated with that budgetary outlay.
