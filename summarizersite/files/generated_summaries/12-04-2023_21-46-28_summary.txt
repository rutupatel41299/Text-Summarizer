Data science is considered a discipline while data scientists are the practitioners within that field.
Data scientists are not necessarily directly responsible for all the processes involved in the data science lifecycle.
Data scientist responsibilities can commonly overlap with a data analyst particularly with exploratory data analysis and data visualization.
However a data scientists skillset is typically broader than the average data analyst.
To perform these tasks data scientists require computer science and pure science skills beyond those of a typical business analyst or data analyst.
