However while the Centre has promised economic stimulus government spending without attention to building adequate state capacity to effectively use those funds will arguably not achieve the desired impact.
We refer to state capacity as the state's ability to provide for its citizens.
During 2020 Budget it was reported that the Centre did not spend 34.9 of the assigned funds in the preceding FY the average magnitude of unspent funds is usually greater at the state and local levels.
While there are several reasons for underutilisation lack of state capacity is a prominent factor.
In a recent paper 'Why Does the Indian State Both Fail and Succeed'
political scientist Devesh Kapur investigates why the Indian state succeeds in some cases such as in executing elections but is unable to fulfil basic quotidien functions including providing welfare payments primary education and sanitation.
The paradoxical nature of India's state capacity has confused many social scientists.
The Indian state is big in some aspects but small in others.
For effective utilisation of funds state capacity needs to be strengthened.
Instilling state capacity needs to be central to India's growth plan for the next few decades if budget intentions are to be translated into effective policy action.
Research shows a positive relationship between high levels of capacity and the development outcomes of a country the effective use of the budget's allocations through building a more capable state can help achieve its goals of development and economic growth.
