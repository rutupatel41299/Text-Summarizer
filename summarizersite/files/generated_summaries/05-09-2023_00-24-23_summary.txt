A meteorite is a solid piece of debris from an object such as a comet asteroid or meteoroid that originates in outer space and survives its passage through the atmosphere to reach the surface of a planet or moon.
For geologists a bolide is a meteorite large enough to create an impact crater.2Meteorites that are recovered after being observed as they transit the atmosphere and impact the Earth are called meteorite falls.
