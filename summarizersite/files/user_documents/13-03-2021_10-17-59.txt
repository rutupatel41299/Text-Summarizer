There are two important strategies to employ when you go grocery shopping: make your shopping list ahead of time and don’t go to the store hungry. Not knowing exactly what you need makes room for impulse buying, while hunger can further exacerbate your impulses. To make sure you don’t give in to your impulses, plan ahead and write down what you need beforehand. By doing this and sticking to your list, you will not only buy healthier items but also save money and have healthier foods around the house.
