                                                                     Assay of boric acid     AIM : To perform the assay of the given sample of boric acid.   APPARATUS:   burette, pipette, conical flask, volumetric flask, measuring cylinder etc.   CHEMICALS : boric acid, glycerol, phenolphthalein, 1N sodium hydroxide solution, 1 N                                oxalic acid.   PRINCIPLE:   The  assay  of  boric  acid  is  based  upon  alkalimetry  method.  Being  a  very  weak  acid,  it  cannot  be  directly  titrated  accurately  with  strong  alkali.  When  it  is  dissolved  in  a  mixture  of  water  and  glycerol  it  behaves  like  a  strong  monobasic  acid  and  then  it  can  be  titrated  with  a  standard  solution of alkali using phenolphthalein as an indicator.     PROCEDURE :    1.  For  standardization  of  sodi umhydroxide:  Into  a  conical  flask  pipette  out  exactly10  ml  of  0.1  N  oxalic  acid  and  add  one  or  two  drops  of  phenolphthalein  indicator.  Titrate  the  solution  against   sodium  hydroxide  solution  until  a  permanent  pink  color  is  obtained.  Repeat  the  titration  to  get  concurrent values.    2. For assay: weigh accurately about 2 gm of boric acid and dissolve in a mixture of 50 ml of water  and 100 ml of glycerol previously neutralized to phenolphthalein solution. Titrate the contents of the  flask with 1 N sodium hydroxi de solution using phenolphthalein as indicator. Repeat the titration for  concurrent values.     I.P. FACTOR :  Each ml of 1 N NaOH   is equivalent to 0.016183 g of boric acid.   FORMULA:      Percent purity of boric acid =  Vol. of  NaOH   x I.P. Factor x 100 x N of  NaOH     (actual)                                                         Weight of boric acid x N of NaOH (exp)     RESULT :  The percentage purity of the given sample of boric acid is ....
