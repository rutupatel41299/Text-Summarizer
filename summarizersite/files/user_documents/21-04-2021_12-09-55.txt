Good nutrition, daily exercise and adequate sleep are the foundations of healthy living. A healthy lifestyle keeps you fit, energetic and at reduced risk for disease. According to WHO, Healthy living is a way of living that helps you enjoy more aspects of your life. It is a way of living that lowers the risk of being seriously ill or dying early. Health is not just about avoiding a disease or illness. It is about physical, mental and social well-being too.When you adopt a healthy lifestyle, you provide a more positive role model for other people in your family, particularly children. You will also create a better environment for them to grow up in. By helping them to follow a healthier lifestyle, you will be contributing to their wellbeing and enjoyment of life now and in the future. Managing stress in positive ways, instead of through smoking or drinking alcohol, reduces wear and tear on your body at the molecular level. For a longer and more comfortable life, you should adopt a healthy life style.
