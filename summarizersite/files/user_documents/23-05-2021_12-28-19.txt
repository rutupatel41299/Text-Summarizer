VascularThe vascular layer of the eye lies underneath the fibrous layer. It consists of the choroid, ciliary body and iris:Choroid – layer of connective tissue and blood vessels. It provides nourishment to the outer layers of the retina.Ciliary body – comprised of two parts – the ciliary muscle and ciliary processes. The ciliary muscle consists of a collection of smooth muscles fibres. These are attached to the lens of the eye by the ciliary processes. The ciliary body controls the shape of the lens, and contributes to the formation of aqueous humorIris – circular structure, with an aperture in the centre (the pupil). The diameter of the pupil is altered by smooth muscle fibres within the iris, which are innervated by the autonomic nervous system. It is situated between the lens and the cornea.
