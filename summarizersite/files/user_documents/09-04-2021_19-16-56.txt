Emulsions are biphasic systems containing two immiscible liquids, one of which is dispersed as minute globules in the other with the help of emulsifying agent.Advantages1. Medicines having unpleasant taste and odor can be made more acceptable for oral administration in the form of an emulsion. Example are castor and cod liver oil.2. Emulsions provide protection to drugs, which are prone to oxidation and hydrolysis. Example is vit-A.3. Various external preparations such as creams, lotions, and aerosols can be formulated in emulsion form.4. Emulsions improve the absorption of oil when taken internally.5. Radio-opaque emulsions are used as diagnostic agents in X-ray examinations.Disadvantages1. Emulsions have a short shelf life. These are unstable and the insoluble phase separates slowly.2. Being liquid dosage forms, these are packed in glass or packed containers. Thus, care should be taken in handling and storage.Type of emulsions:These are four types of emulsion: Oil in water emulsions (o/w): in this type, oil is dispersed phase, water is continuous phase. This type of emulsion is preferred for internal use. Water in oil emulsions (w/o): in this type, water is dispersed phase and oil is continuous phase.  Multiple emulsions. Micro emulsions.Method of preparations:Mortar and pestle can be used to prepare in small scale using the following methods. Dry gum method: example is arachis oil emulsion (o/w type) using acacia as emulsifying agent. Wet gum method: example is castor oil emulsion (w/o type) using acacia as emulsifying agent. Bottle method: for example, turpentine liniment IP (o/w type) is prepared using soap as emulsifying agent.
