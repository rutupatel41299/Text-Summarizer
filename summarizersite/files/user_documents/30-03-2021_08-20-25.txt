Tropical   Storm   Gilbert   strengthened   into   an   eastern   Caribbean   hurricane   on   Saturday     night,   September   10,   1988.    Government   officials   of   the   island   nations   in   its   westerly     path   issued   alerts,   warnings   and   orders   to   evacuate   their   southerly - exposed   coastal   areas.      Puerto   Rico,   Haiti   and   the   Dominican   escaped   with   only   some   coastal   floodi ng   and   a   few     deaths   before   Gilbert   continued   on   to   strike   Jamaica   with   110mph   winds   and   torrential     rains.    The   storm,   now   one   of   the   largest   systems   seen   in   the   Ca ribbean   fo r   a   long   time,     slowly   traversed   the   length   of   the   island   causing   massive   damage   and   ninet een   deaths.      100,000   of   Jamaica's   500,000   homes   were   destroyed   leaving   500,000   people   h omeless.      The   storm   then   passed   over   the   Cayman   Islands   located   sou th   of   Cuba.    Cuba   and   our     American   military   bases   there   both   avoided   the   brunt   of   the   storm   before   i t   slammed   full     force   into   the   Yucatan   Peninsula.    By   now   Gilbert   had   strengthened   into   th e   most   severe     hurricane   ever   recorded   with   barometric   pressure   o f   26.31   inches   and   susta ined   winds   of     179mph,   gusting   to   218mph.    Relief   efforts   for   the   heavily   damaged   Cancun   and     Cozumel   areas   were   hindered   due   to   massive   flooding   and   power   and   phone   ou tages.      Scientists   do   not   fully   understand   why   some   minor   tropi cal   storms   strength en   into     hurricanes,   while   others   do   not.
