Solutions are defined as liquid preparations containing one or more chemical substances usually dissolved in water. A solution is a mixture of two compounds namely solute and solvent. Solute is the small component present in the solution and is usually non-volatile in nature. Solvent is the larger component present and is known as vehicle.Most of the drugs are non-polar or semi polar hence these cannot be easily solubilized in water. Therefore, special methods are used to prepare solutions. Solubility can be enhanced by using ingredients like co solvents (glycerin, propyl glycol,) or surfactants (example is cresol with soap solution), or by method like complexation (example is a combination of iodine and potassium iodide). Solutions are usually being used for their specific therapeutic effects of solute either internally or externally. These vary widely in composition, method of preparation, strength, potency, mode of administration, use and dosage. To increase the self-life and aesthetic value of solutions, various additives are added such as stabilizers, coloring agents, sweetening agents. Solutions form most of the dosage form like mixtures, enemas, mouth washes, gargle, ear drops, eye drops, etc.
